-------------------------------------
Input:
	head = [1,2,3,4,5] 
	k = 2
Output:
    head = [4,5,1,2,3]
Explanation:
    We have to rotate the list to the right twice.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Solution: Brute Force

Approach:

    We have to move the last element to first for each k.

    For each k, find the last element from the list. Move it to the first.

Time Complexity: O(nodes * k)
Reason: For k times, we are iterating through the entire list to get the last element and move it to first.

Space Complexity: O(1)
_______________________________________________________________________
Solution: Optimal Solution

Approach:

    Letâ€™s take an example. 

    head = [1,2,3,4,5] k = 2000000000

    -> If we see brute force approach, it will take O(5*2000000000) which is not a good time complexity when we can optimize it.

    -> We can see that for every k which is multiple of the length of the list, we get back the original list. Try to operate brute force on any linked list for k as multiple of the length of the list.

    -> This gives us a hint that for k greater than the length of the list, we have to rotate the list for k % length of the list. This reduces our time complexity.

    -> Steps to the algorithm:-

        -> Calculate length of the list
        -> Connect the last node to the first node, converting it to a circular linked list.
        -> Iterate to cut the link of the last node and start a node of k % length of list rotated list.
