Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]

Explanation: Out of all possible unique triplets possible, [-1,-1,2] and [-1,0,1] satisfy the condition of summing up to zero with i!=j!=k
_____________________________________________________________
Solution 1 (Brute Force): (3 for loops)
Approach: 
    We keep three-pointers i,j, and k. For every triplet we find the sum of A[i]+A[j]+A[k]. If this sum is equal to zero, weâ€™ve found one of the triplets. We add it to our data structure and continue with the rest.

Time Complexity : O(n^3)   // 3 loops
Space Complexity : O(3*k)  // k is the no.of triplets
____________________________________________________________________
Solution 2 (Optimized Approach): (fix i, and then 2 pointer approach)

Approach:
    We could make use of the fact that we just need to return the triplets and thus could possibly sort the array. This would help us use a modified two-pointer approach to this problem.

    Eg) Input :  [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]

    After sorting, our array is : [-4,-1,-1,0,1,2]

    -> Notice, we are fixing the i pointer and then applying the traditional 2 pointer approach to check whether the sum of three numbers equals zero. 
    -> If the sum is less than zero, it indicates our sum is probably too less and we need to increment our j pointer to get a larger sum. 
    -> On the other hand, if our sum is more than zero, it indicates our sum is probably too large and we need to decrement the k pointer to reduce the sum and bring it closer to zero.

Time Complexity : O(n^2)  

Space Complexity : O(M).
